### Syntax

**Markdown Syntax Overview:**

- **Headers:** Use `#` for headers. The number of `#` symbols determines the header level (e.g., `#` for H1, `##` for H2, and so on).
- **Bold, Italic:** Use double asterisks for bold (`**bold text**`) and single asterisks for italic (`*italic text*`).
- **Bullet Points:** Use `-`, `*`, or `+` for bullet points.
- **Numbered Lists:** Use numbers followed by periods for numbered lists.
- **Code Blocks:** Use triple backticks (````) before and after a block of code to format it as code.
- **Links:** Use `[link text](URL)` to create hyperlinks.
- **Images:** Use `![alt text](image URL)` to insert images.
- **Tables:** Use pipes (`|`) to create columns and hyphens (`-`) to create horizontal lines.
